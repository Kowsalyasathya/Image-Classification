# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Image Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for image classification and to verify the response for new images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset. The FashionMNIST dataset contains grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories (e.g., T-shirt, trousers, dress, etc.), and the model aims to classify them correctly. The challenge is to achieve high accuracy while ensuring computational efficiency.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Define the goal of classifying fashion apparel items into 10 categories using a CNN. Ensure high accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

### STEP 2:
Use the FashionMNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of clothing items. Each image is 28Ã—28 grayscale and labeled with one of 10 classes.

### STEP 3:
Convert images to tensors and normalize pixel values to [0,1]. Use DataLoaders for efficient batch processing during training and testing.

### STEP 4: 
Design a CNN with convolutional layers for feature extraction, ReLU activation, pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers for classification.

### STEP 5:
Train the CNN using CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer for multiple epochs. Monitor accuracy and loss to ensure proper learning.

### STEP 6: Model Evaluation
Test the model on unseen FashionMNIST data, compute performance metrics, and analyze using a confusion matrix.

### STEP 7: Model Deployment & Visualization
Save the trained model for future use and visualize predictions on sample test images. Optionally, integrate into an application for real-world use.
